# Half-Life Backwards

This soft-mod allows the player to backtrack from Interloper all the way back to Anomalous Materials with a few ammo and health replenishments.\
*It's confusing and not really recommended for casual players! Have fun!*

Some level transitions are nonexistent or fail to keep track of player's weapons, because of that the mod loads a full-loaded preset save.
If you find yourself stuck, try checking for normal triggers using `bxt_show_triggers 1`.

### Requirements
